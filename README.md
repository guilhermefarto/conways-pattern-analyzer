# conways-pattern-analyzer

Python project for

* (i) [Conway's Pattern Analyzer](#conways-pattern-analyzer) - a pattern analyzer approach for simulation and verification of cell patterns of types (i) oscillator and (ii) still life based on the context of Conway's Game of Life ([examples](#all-examples))

## Dependencies

The .py project adopts [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python - and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) - a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

First, upgrade `pip`to the latest version by executing the command in the prompt `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.

It is possible to the full SciPy stack - a scientific package that contains several components, e.g., Numpy, Simpy, and Pandas - from [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) (PIP).

Then install the SciPy stack packages with `pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose`.

For Windows users, the SciPy [official page](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) recommends the use of [pre-built Windows installers](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) for many Python packages, including all of the core SciPy stack. Some pre-built Windows installers can ben also downloaded from [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/) and [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.16.1/).

To install the `Matplotlib` dependency from [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) (PIP), execute the command in the prompt `python -m pip install matplotlib`.

Other dependencies of this project are native to Python platform:

```python
  import os
  import errno
  import argparse
  import time
```
